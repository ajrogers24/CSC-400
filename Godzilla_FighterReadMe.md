Thank you for checking out my Godzilla fighter game!

Overview: This project is a RPG style game developed to act as a fighter game similar to the style of PokÃ©mon. In this game you will be faced and challenged with making decsions of attacks and defense based off of your oppenent. Each player will start the game at 100 health and you will take turns with the AI to try and get their health to 0 before yours gets there! You will have the choice of several different attacks and also ways to regenerate health. But, be careful because some of your attacks can be more risky than others in terms of how much damage you actually do to your opponent.

Major parts: Ability to enter your fighters name. Different styles of attacks and defense for you to fight the style that you choose.

Instructions/How to Play: Simply download the GodzillaFighter.py file to your computer -> Then launch any IDE of your choice. Not sure what an IDE is? It is an integrated development environment used for programming. Here is a link to my favorite if you need to download one! https://code.visualstudio.com Once you have your IDE, simply launch it and go to File -> Open File, and select the GodzillaFighter.py file you downloaded earlier. From here when the code launches, you can click run and the game will simply run through your terminal! Thanks again for checking out my game, I hope you enjoy.
